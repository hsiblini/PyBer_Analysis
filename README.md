### Summary
It is important to realize that there is a large gap in fares between urban, suburban and rural ridership. This is directly due to the fact that urban populations are generally much higher than suburuban and rural populations. In order to encourage higher numbers among urban and rural riders, one may consider lowering the prices in those regions.
